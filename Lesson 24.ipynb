    "Type I error is the event that we rejected the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis was actually true. Type I error is also known as a false positive. The probability of a Type I error is usually defined by the threshold used for rejection. A common threshold is 0.05. Those of you who have taken statistics before may recognize this value as $\\alpha$. \n",

The probability of a Type II error is harder to find and requires a more in-depth analysis of a hypothesis test. The probability of a Type II error is often given as $\\beta$, and $1-\\beta$ is referred to as **Power**. The power of a test is probability that we will reject the null hypothesis when we are supposed to. \n",
