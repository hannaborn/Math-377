    "### Example 1: The Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"lady tasting tea\" problem is a now famous story during which, at a gathering one summer afternoon in Cambridge, some friends drank tea with milk. Among them, a woman claimed to be able to tell, based on taste, whether the milk or the tea was added first to the cup. A now famous statistician, Ronald Fisher, was at the gathering, and he studied the claim. The woman was offered 8 cups of tea mixed with milk (4 with milk added first and 4 with tea added first) and she successfully identified 6 (3 of each). What can we say about her ability to discriminate the teas? "
